# WikiBlurb
A simple python program for reading summaries about things retrieved from Wikipedia

### Purpose
This was an opportunity to mess around with REST calls and GUIs. I plan on using this as a reference later, and may add some features for fun later.

### To Run
In the main directory of the project (.../WikiBlurb):  
`$ python3 wikiblurb.py`  
then type a query and hit "Get Blurb" button or press enter
